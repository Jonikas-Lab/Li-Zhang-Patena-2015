    """ Gives p-value for whether two lists of category counts are different, using the chi-square test.

    Dof_subtract is how many degrees of freedom to SUBTRACT from the default (usually no adjustment needed, 0).

    If return_pvalue_only is True, returns only pvalue, otherwise (chisquare_statistic, pvalue).

    Raises ValueError if any count is below min_count - the chi-square test shouldn't be used for small numbers, 
     use Fisher's exact test instead.

    NOTE ON HOW THIS WORKS: to do a chi-square test of independence, you compare the counts of eiter category to expected counts, 
     where expected counts are CALCULATED FROM BOTH CATEGORIES - you DON'T directly compare one to the other,
      the way you do in a goodness-of-fit test!
        EXAMPLE: if counts_A are 110 and 90, and counts_B are 190 and 10, you don't do a chisquare on [110,90], [190,10], 
         but calculate the expected counts for all four categories from the row/column totals: 
          from A+B (110+190=300 and 90+10=100), so since sum(A) and sum(B) are both 200, the expected is [150,50,150,50]. 
          So compare [110,90,190,10] (A and B together) to [150,50,150,50] using the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, 
          BUT make a degree-of-freedom adjustment: the comparison we're REALLY doing is 2*3 (comparing two 3-length datasets), 
           so the degrees of freedom should be (2-1)*(3-1) = 2.  However, we're transforming it in to a comparison between 
            6-length observed and expected datasets, with (2-1)*(6-1)=5 degrees of freedom by default, 
           so we need to subtract 3 from the degrees-of-freedom for the test (in addition to whatever dof_subtract we already have). 

        EXAMPLE 2: what if the totals in A and B are different?  Say A is [110,190] and B is [90,10]. 
            Then the overall counts are [200,200], so we should be comparing [110,190,90,10] to [150,150,50,50]. 
            Again, with DOF adjustment of 3.

    See https://udel.edu/~mcdonald/statchiind.html for source and description of how it should work, 
     and more examples at http://stattrek.com/chi-square-test/independence.aspx 
     and http://omega.albany.edu:8008/mat108dir/chi2independence/chi2in-m2h.html - it was confusing to me at first.

# OLD NOTES ON FDR CORRECTION:
    # How to do FDR correction?  According to the Handbook of Biological Statistics (https://udel.edu/~mcdonald/statmultcomp.html), Benjamini-Hochberg correction is probably what I want.  They describe a procedure, but it's slightly odd, because it doesn't give a p-value (q-value?) for each window, just a yes/no significance result based on the p-value and the desired false discovery rate. 
    # I didn't find any obvious way of doing this directly in python, but there's an R function "p.adjust" (http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/p.adjust.html), which I can use in python with rpy2 (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7450957/how-to-implement-rs-p-adjust-in-python).  Trying that, with just a few test values:
    #  * get the p_values for a few mutant counts per bin, between 0 and 15:
    #     >>> p_values = [scipy.stats.binom_test(x,12061,20000/113000000) for x in (0,0,1,2,5,10,10,25,25)]
    #     >>> p_values
